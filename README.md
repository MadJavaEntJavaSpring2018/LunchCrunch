﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿## The Four Musketeers -Team Project - Madison College's Enterprise Java Class# LunchCrunch### Problem StatementThe Four Musketeers Team was assigned an initiative by their employer to create opportunities for employees to get to know each other.  The company just merged with another and it is imperative for employees to engage in a meaningful way to meet crucial business goals that will reinvent the new company for the future.Four Musketeers are suggesting that employees use some of their lunch times to meet with business partners and co-worker’s to discuss different topics.  To help employees facilitate this mandatory meeting times a LunchCrunch Web Service will be created and deployed on the Intranet site.### Project Technologies/Techniques * Database  * MySQL  * Store users and roles * ORM Framework  * Hibernate 5* Dependency Management  * Maven* CSS and HTML  * Data Validation  * Hibernate's validation* Logging  * Configurable logging using Log4J2.  * Hosting  * AWS* Unit Testing  * JUnit tests to achieve 80%+ code coverage * IDE: IntelliJ IDEA### Design* [Screen Design](DesignDocuments)* [Application Flow](DesignDocuments)* [Database Design](https://github.com/MadJavaEntJavaSpring2018/LunchCrunch/blob/master/design_documents/table_design_diagram.jpeg)### [Project Plan](Project Plan.md)
