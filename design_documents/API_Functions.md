# API Functions


I'm assuming the web service will be called LunchCrunch, so an example call to the api may look something like this:

```
localhost:8080/LunchCrunch/users
```

Table | Function | Method | Description
----- | -------- |:------:| -----------
user | /LunchCrunch/users | GET | List all the users
user | /LunchCrunch/users?bsmith | GET | List user Bob Smith
user | /LunchCrunch/users?mjones?Mary?Jones?mypassword | PUT | Add user Mary Jones, or if she does not exist, add her
appointment | |
topic | |
